26th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE 2014)
================================================================================

On 16 June, I presented a paper at the EMMSAD[^emmsad] workshop as part
of the 26th International Conference
on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE). This year's conference was
held in Thessaloniki, Greece.

The Paper
---------

The paper I presented explored possibilities of utilising Soft
Systems Methodology combined with formal UML modelling to design an application
such as BBC Search from the ground up. This hints at further possibilities for
projects within BBC Future Media to benefit from such analysis, continuous
monitoring and systems design. The use of soft systems can also
emphasise a focus on the whole BBC as “One Service” and how decisions we make
affect our relationships with the audience (and the relationships with other
development teams).

The work stemmed out of a collaboration between BBC Academy and Bournemouth
University to produce a masters-level module on Systems Design as part
of the MSc in Software Engineering offered by BBC Academy. The course tutor,
Huseyin Dogan, has done previous work to explore transitioning from soft systems
built up through interactive workshops to “hard” models
traditionally done through modelling languages, e.g. UML.

This previous work inspired me to explore beyond traditional modelling based on
technical knowledge and assumptions alone and seek to find better ways to
contextualise and gather input on the problems we solve day to day (and perhaps
effectively monitor and evaluate our solutions for success).

EMMSAD
------

My exploration of bringing more formal analysis and modelling methods into
day-to-day development practice was serendipitously aligned with the theme of
the keynote that opened both EMMSAD and BPMDS[^bpmds] workshops.

The opening keynote talk by Gil Regev[^regev] focused on the gap between
academia and industry in the domain of business process and systems modelling.
The presentation highlighted that both workshops combined
only four different papers from industry practitioners (one of which
was my own) and urged researchers to take up positions in companies for 1-2
years to gain more experience of real world problems and reinforce the
theory in their research.

The talk also covered the difficulty in bringing new ideas or approaches into
teams within enterprises due to change aversion.
