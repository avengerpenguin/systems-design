26th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE 2014)

On 16 June, I presented a paper[^paper] at the EMMSAD[^emmsad] workshop as part
of the 26th International Conference
on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE). This year's conference was
held in Thessaloniki, Greece.

The paper I presented explored possibilities of utilising Soft
Systems Methodology[^ssm] combined with formal UML modelling to design an application
such as BBC Search from the ground up.
The work stemmed out of a collaboration between BBC Academy and Bournemouth
University to produce a masters-level module on Systems Design as part
of the MSc in Software Engineering offered by BBC Academy.

The use of soft systems can
emphasise a focus on the whole BBC as “One Service” and how decisions we make
affect our relationships with the audience (and the relationships with other
Future Media teams). At the very least, it can give appropriate context
to help us design, build and evaluate the technical systems we create.

I would hope that my attending such a conference is a step in the direction
of bringing together the best of research and enterprise worlds.
Maintaining a presence amongst those in research and contributing our
practical experiences to the scientific literature can raise the profile of
BBC Future Media as a world-class
centre of software engineering practices in addition to its existing global
name in the realm of broadcast technologies.
